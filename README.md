# neopz-python
This project implements Python bindings for [NeoPZ]([https://github.com/labmec/neopz](https://github.com/labmec/neopz)) finite element library using [pybind11]([[https://github.com/pybind/pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)).
Make sure you have both libraries (and CMake!) installed in your environment.

To install the module, clone this repository and run:
```
$ python3 setup.py develop
```
(You'll may need `sudo` for this depending on where `python3` is installed in your machine.)
